 ================================ Setting Container Up! ================================

  :: The Array Is Seted! ::
Array = {3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 2}
The length of the Array is 6

 ================================ Sorting The Elements! ================================

  :: Soting From Min To Max ::
{1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5}

  :: Soting From Max To Min ::
{5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1}

 ================================= Adding New Element! =================================

  :: AddElementWithIndex(value: 10,index: 3) ::
Array = {3, 1, 5, 10, 4, 2, 2}
The length of the Array is 7

  :: See New Sort Array ::

In This Program Input Array Sorted Just One Time!
And Then We Work With Sorted Array; (see Container Class)
{1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10}

  :: Adding without Index: AddNewElement(23) ::
Array = {3, 1, 5, 10, 4, 2, 2, 23}
The length of the Array is 8


 ================================= Deleting An Element =================================

  :: Deleting by Index: DeleteElementByIndex(7) ::
Array = {3, 1, 5, 10, 4, 2, 2}
The length of the Array is 7

  :: Deleting by value: DeleteElementByValue(2) ::
(We have two times 2 and we want delet them)
Array = {3, 1, 5, 10, 4}
The length of the Array is 5

  :: See New Sort Array ::
{1, 3, 4, 5, 10}

  :: I added two timed 2 at the end of array again ::


 ================================= Searching An Element =================================

  :: It return An Array That contains Indices Of All searched Value in our Array ::
  :: We are going to search 2 ::

We have 2 times 2 in our Array. The indices are 6  and  5  

 ================================= I Hope You Enjoy It =================================
